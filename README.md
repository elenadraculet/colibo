#colibo test

The application was built using ReactJS and Bootstrap 4.
I have chosen React because it allows to build rich user  / interfaces by using components.
React fetches data from external API `https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers` and renders the components for displaying the data to the user.
Bootstrap makes styles the results' appearance.


##Home page
Initially, the user sees 10 beers and has the option to load more bears using the 'Load more' button.
When seeing results, there is also a filtering option before the beers are listed.
To filter, the user has to search by the beer name.


##Beer details page
By clicking the 'View more' button, user is taken to a page where are displayed more details about the selected beer.
To go back to the initial list, there is a 'Go back' option at the top of the page.
